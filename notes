Gather

Part of a larger project, with this section covering the gathering of intel and data exposure information.

The idea is to pull info from multiple sources, here, and insert the results in a database for a 'Process' project.

The results of that 'Process' project will then be displayed in an API and web app, 'Display'.

These 3 projects (Gather, Process, Display) will be combined into one larger project at a later time.

Initial sources for this gathering are:

- California AG page that lists data breaches and has links to the PDF files that are sent to affected users.
(check other states as well for similar sites - not every site has this type of information)

- Github DMCA page, check for updates and insert this data into a DB.

- Possibly Twitter, following users and/or doing periodic searches.

- Add other sources as they come up.

This data will be placed in MongoDB for later retrieval and processing (by the 'Process' project).

Process part will (possibly) retrieve from Mongo, process, and place in another directory.
